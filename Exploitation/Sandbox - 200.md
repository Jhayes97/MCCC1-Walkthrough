# Guide

Initially, the first step to a challenge involving code is to read the source.

We can see that it has a specific list of words that if we try to use, it will give us an `ERROR`.

Unfortuately most of the commands it bans are the easiest routes to a sandbox escape. Referring back to the source, we can also see that it allows us one exec() statement. This is only mildly interesting as allowing us eval() would be more useful.

Seeing as it has removed most of the fun commands, most people would think they are entirely stripped from our hands. However, Python is largely just references to objects, and as opposed to deleting the objects directly, the source only deletes the reference to the object.

This resource here explains in much greater detail the process we will be using to get back the objects.

`Because that resource is how I learned how to do this trick, I ask that you read through it instead of me explaining the methods we're doing instead. Essentially the following image shows the result of regaining the ability to read a file, in this case, flag.txt.`

We have our flag: **flag{python_sandboxes_arent_really_sandboxes_at_all}**
